# Challenge

There is a node js app running on test.com which returns sensitive data in response at /userdata endpoint and during testing you found an xss on sub.test.com
will you be able to steal sensitive data returned on this endpoint?

Test plan: host app on your localhost then host xss page on sub.localhost

Bug tested on Chrome Version 105.0.5195.125 and chromium Version 108.0.5359 so prefered browser is chrome.
